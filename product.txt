## Features

### 🎯 Precise AI Segmentation
Our BiRefNet-powered engine detects subjects with exceptional accuracy, handling:
- **Complex hair and fur details**
- **Transparent objects** (glasses, smoke, water)
- **Motion blur** from fast movements
- **Varying lighting conditions**

**Result**: Clean masks with minimal manual cleanup needed.

---

### ⚡ Real-Time Processing
No waiting hours for results. Our optimized pipeline processes:
- **30-second clips**: ~15 seconds
- **1-minute videos**: ~30 seconds  
- **5-minute videos**: ~2.5 minutes

**Speed**: 2.5x faster than real-time on modern GPUs.

---

### 🎨 Multiple Background Modes

#### 1. Transparent Background
Export with alpha channel for professional compositing in:
- Premiere Pro

- Final Cut Pro

**Format**: WebM (VP9) with alpha channel

#### 2. Green Screen
Instant chroma key replacement—no physical green screen needed.

---

## How It Works

### Step 1: Upload Your Video
Drag and drop any video file:
- **Supported formats**: MP4, MOV, WebM
- **Max duration**: Up to 10 minutes (free tier)
- **Resolution**: Up to 4K (1080p recommended for speed)

### Step 2: AI Processing
Our BiRefNet model analyzes each frame:
1. **Semantic segmentation** identifies the subject
2. **Boundary refinement** captures fine details (hair, edges)
3. **Temporal consistency** ensures smooth transitions
4. **Alpha compositing** generates transparent output

**Time**: Typically 0.5-2x video length

### Step 3: Customize & Export
- Choose background mode (transparent, green screen, custom)
- Preview in real-time with built-in player
- Download in your preferred format
- Start a new project instantly

## FAQ

### How accurate is the background removal?
Our BiRefNet model achieves 89% mIoU on standard benchmarks, outperforming most consumer tools. Quality depends on video clarity, lighting, and subject contrast.

### Can it handle multiple people?
Yes, but optimal for 1-3 subjects. The model treats all foreground subjects as one group.

### What about copyright on output videos?
You retain full rights to processed videos. Our AI doesn't train on your content.

### Do you support audio?
Audio is preserved in preview MP4 files. WebM exports are video-only (for compositing).

### Can I use this commercially?
Yes, both free and self-hosted versions allow commercial use under MIT license.

### What file sizes can I upload?
Free tier: Up to 500MB per video. Self-hosted: No limit.

### Is there a mobile app?
Not yet, but the web app is mobile-responsive for uploads. Processing requires GPU.
